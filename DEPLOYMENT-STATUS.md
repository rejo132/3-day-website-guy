# 🚀 Portfolio Deployment Status

## ✅ **What's Been Accomplished:**

### 1. **Images Updated & Committed**
- ✅ Profile photo: `rejesho-profile.jpg` - Made BIGGER and more prominent
- ✅ Dream Journal screenshot: `dream-journal.jpg`
- ✅ Expense Tracker screenshot: `expense-tracker.jpg`
- ✅ Quote Generator screenshot: `quote-generator.jpg`

### 2. **Code Improvements**
- ✅ Fixed hydration error (replaced Math.random with deterministic positioning)
- ✅ Made profile picture much larger (48x48 → 64x64 on large screens)
- ✅ Improved hero section spacing and layout
- ✅ Enhanced typography for profile section

### 3. **Git Status**
- ✅ All changes committed to main branch
- ✅ All changes pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Images are properly tracked by git

## 🔄 **Deployment Process:**

### **Netlify Auto-Deploy**
Your site at `https://3-day-website-guy.netlify.app` will automatically update because:
1. ✅ Changes are committed to GitHub main branch
2. ✅ Netlify is connected to your GitHub repository
3. ✅ Netlify will detect the new commit and rebuild

### **Expected Timeline**
- **Immediate**: Changes are live on GitHub
- **5-10 minutes**: Netlify should start building
- **10-15 minutes**: New site should be live with your real images

## 🎯 **What You Should See After Deployment:**

### **Bigger Profile Picture**
- Profile photo is now **much larger** (256x256px on large screens)
- More prominent placement in the hero section
- Better spacing and typography

### **Real Images Instead of Placeholders**
- Your actual portrait photo
- Real project screenshots
- No more placeholder images

## 🔍 **If Images Still Don't Show on Deployed Site:**

### **Check Netlify Build Logs**
1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Check the latest deployment
3. Look for any build errors

### **Verify Image URLs**
The deployed site should have these images accessible at:
- `/profile/rejesho-profile.jpg`
- `/projects/dream-journal.jpg`
- `/projects/expense-tracker.jpg`
- `/projects/quote-generator.jpg`

## 🎉 **Current Status:**
**All changes committed and pushed! Netlify should deploy automatically within 10-15 minutes.**

Your portfolio will soon display your real images with a much bigger, more prominent profile picture!
