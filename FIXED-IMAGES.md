# âœ… IMAGE ISSUE FIXED!

## ðŸŽ¯ **The Problem**
You were viewing your **deployed Netlify site** (`https://3-day-website-guy.netlify.app`) instead of your **local development server**. The deployed site doesn't have your new images yet, so it was showing 400 errors.

## ðŸš€ **The Solution**

### **View Your Local Development Server**
Go to: **`http://localhost:3001`** (not the Netlify URL)

Your local server has all your new images and will display them correctly!

## ðŸ“‹ **Steps to See Your New Images:**

1. **Open your browser**
2. **Go to**: `http://localhost:3001`
3. **You should now see your real images!**

## ðŸ”§ **What I Fixed:**

1. âœ… **Identified the issue**: You were viewing deployed site instead of local server
2. âœ… **Updated test files**: Changed port from 3000 to 3001
3. âœ… **Removed debug components**: No longer needed
4. âœ… **Cache-busting**: Added `?v=2` to force image reload

## ðŸ“¸ **Your Images Should Now Show:**

- **Profile Photo**: Your portrait in the hero section
- **Dream Journal**: Screenshot of your dream journal app
- **Expense Tracker**: Screenshot of your expense tracker app  
- **Quote Generator**: Screenshot of your quote generator app

## ðŸš€ **To Deploy with New Images:**

When you're ready to deploy your updated site with the new images:

1. **Commit your changes**: `git add . && git commit -m "Updated images"`
2. **Push to GitHub**: `git push`
3. **Netlify will automatically deploy** with your new images

## ðŸŽ‰ **You're All Set!**

Your portfolio now displays your real photos and project screenshots instead of placeholders!
